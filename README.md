# evaluatordilemma

This repository contains data and analysis code to reproduce results from the article **"Towards a Methodological Toolkit to Mitigate the Evaluatorâ€™s Dilemma: a Case Study of Pastoralist Communal Rangelands Management"**.

All data is stored in `/data`. The script `R/compute_results.R` loads these data and computes all results (fitting models, creating tables and figures, ...), also sourcing the custom funtions in `R/functions.R`. In `R/draw_dags.R`, the causal graphs shown in the article are drawn.
